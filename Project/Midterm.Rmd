## Midterm: Project Plan

Choose a spatiotemporal data set and define a problem (or problems) you want to solve, e.g. regression, classification, prediction, etc.
Try to use the techniques you learned from the class. But do not be limited to them. Feel free to adopt machine learning/deep learning methods and make comparison.

For the midterm, you need to write a report of planning your data analysis which should includes:

- Choice of the data set and a brief description.
- Problem(s) you plan to solve.

The report should not exceed 2 pages. Submit it to canvas in pdf.

## No Teamwork

Each individual needs to submit a proposal to canvas.

For submission:

- Submit only an `pdf` or word `doc` file.
- The file should clearly contain your **name** and **ASU ID**.

You can find datasets at [UCI machine learning data repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php).
