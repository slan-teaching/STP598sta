## Question 1

(a) Given latitude ($\theta$) and longitude ($\lambda$) of two locations $P_1$ and $P_2$. Obtain the formula to calculate the geodesic distance $D$.

(b) Use the earth radius $R=6371$ km. Can you compute the geodesic distances: (1) between Phoenix (33.28N, 112.03W) and Chicago (41.52N, 87.39W), and (2) between New York (40.43N, 73.56W) and Los Angeles (34.03N, 118.15W)?


## Question 2

Consider the time series, $Y_t=X=\sin(\omega t+\theta)$ (so $X$ is the amplitude, $\omega$ is the frequency and $\theta$ is the phase) where $X$ is distributed with mean 0 and variance 1 independent of $\theta\sim \mathrm{unif}(-\pi, \pi)$). Show that $Y_t$ is weakly stationary.


<!-- ## Question 1 -->

<!-- The \emph{turning bands method} (Christakos, 1984; Stein, 1999a) is a technique for creating stationary covariance functions on $\mathbb R^r$. Let ${\bf u}$ be a random unit vector on $\mathbb R^r$ (by random we mean that the coordinate vector that defines ${\bf u}$ is randomly chosen on the surface of the unit sphere in $\mathbb R^r$). Let $c(\cdot)$ be a valid stationary covariance function on $\mathbb R^1$, and let $W(t)$ be a process on $\mathbb R^1$ having $c(\cdot)$ as its covariance function. Then for any location ${\bf s}\in\mathbb R^r$, define $$Y({\bf s})=W({\bf s}^T{\bf u}).$$ Note that we can think of the process either conditionally given ${\bf u}$, or marginally by integrating with respect to the uniform distribution for ${\bf u}$. Note also that $Y({\bf s})$ has the possibly undersirable property that it is constant on planes (i.e. on ${\bf s}^T{\bf u}=k$). -->

<!-- (a) If $W$ is a Gaussian process, show that, given ${\bf u}$, $Y({\bf s})$ is also a Gaussian process and is stationary. -->

<!-- (b) Show that marginally $Y({\bf s})$ is \emph{not} a Gaussian process, but is isotropic. -->
<!-- [Hint: Show that $\mathrm{Cov}(Y({\bf s},Y({\bf s'})=\mathrm{E}_{\bf u}c(({\bf s}-{\bf s'})^T{\bf u})$.] -->

## Question 3

Show that a valid variogram $\gamma(\cdot)$ satisfies the negative definiteness condition, i.e. for any set of locations ${\bf s}_1,\cdots, {\bf s}_n$ and any set of $a_1,\cdots, a_n$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i=0$, we have
$$\sum_i\sum_j a_ia_j\gamma({\bf s}_i-{\bf s}_j) \leq 0$$


## Question 4

Consider the `coalash` data frame in the `gstat` package in `R` and available from [here](https://www.counterpointstat.com/uploads/1/1/9/3/119383887/coal.ash.txt). 
This data comes from the Pittsburgh coal seam on the Robena Mine Property in Greene County, PA (Cressie, 1993, p. 32). 
This data frame contains 208 coal ash core samples (the variable coal in the data frame) collected on a grid given by $x$ and $y$ planar coordinates (\emph{not} latitude and longitude).

(a) Plot the sampled sites embedded on a map of the region. Add contour lines to the plot.

(b) Provide a descriptive summary (histograms, stems, quantiles, means, range, etc.) of the variable coal in the data frame.

(c) Plot variograms and correlograms of the response and comment on the need for spatial analysis here.

(d) If you think that there is need for spatial analysis, arrive at your best estimates of the range, nugget, and sill.
